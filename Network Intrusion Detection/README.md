> \*\*A machine learning-powered Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) that classifies network traffic as normal or malicious — detecting 4 major attack categories with high accuracy — deployed as a live Flask web application.\*\*

\---

## 📌 Problem Statement

With the rapid growth of computer networks, **cybersecurity threats** are more dangerous and frequent than ever. Traditional rule-based security systems struggle to keep up with evolving attack patterns. This project builds a **machine learning-based NIDS** that can:

* Automatically detect whether network activity is **normal or an attack** (binary classification)
* Identify the **specific type of attack** across 4 major categories (multi-class classification)
* Replace slow, manual rule-writing with a **data-driven, adaptive** detection system

Achieving **98%+ detection rate** while keeping false alarm rates minimal — a benchmark reported in academic research on anomaly detection.

## 🎯 Business \& Security Impact

|Stakeholder|Value Delivered|
|-|-|
|**Security Operations (SOC)**|Real-time automated triage of network alerts|
|**IT Administrators**|Instantly identify attack type without manual log analysis|
|**Enterprises**|Reduce Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) for cyber incidents|
|**Government / Defense**|Protect critical infrastructure from advanced persistent threats|

\---

## 🧠 Attack Categories Detected

This system classifies network traffic into **5 classes** — Normal plus 4 attack types:

|Attack Type|Description|Example|
|-|-|-|
|**Normal**|Legitimate network traffic|Regular HTTP, FTP, SSH requests|
|**DOS**|Denial of Service — overwhelms resources to cause outage|SYN flood, Ping of Death|
|**PROBE**|Surveillance/scanning to gather network info|Port scanning, Nmap|
|**R2L**|Remote-to-Local — unauthorized access from a remote machine|Password guessing, FTP exploits|
|**U2R**|User-to-Root — privilege escalation to gain root access|Buffer overflow, Rootkit installation|

\---

## 🔍 Approach

### 1\. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Generated automated profiling report using **pandas-profiling** (`pandas\_profiling.html`) — a full statistical summary of all 41 features
* Analysed **correlation matrix** (`corrm.csv`) to identify redundant or highly correlated features
* Studied class imbalance across 5 attack categories
* Summarised numerical feature distributions (`num\_summary.csv`) to guide preprocessing

### 2\. Data Preprocessing \& Feature Engineering

* Handled **categorical features**: `protocol\_type` (tcp/udp/icmp), `service`, `flag` — encoded to numerical format
* Applied **label encoding** for multi-class target variable
* Feature selection based on correlation analysis to reduce dimensionality

### 3\. Two-Layer Classification Strategy

**Problem 1 — Binary Classification:**

```
Input: Network Traffic Features
Output: Normal (0) or Attack (1)
```

**Problem 2 — Multi-class Classification:**

```
Input: Network Traffic Features
Output: Normal | DOS | PROBE | R2L | U2R
```

Both problems are solved using the same trained model, allowing flexible deployment.

### 4\. Model Training \& Serialization

* Trained a high-accuracy classification model on NSL-KDD training set
* Evaluated on held-out test set with focus on precision, recall, and F1-score per class
* Serialized final model as `model.pkl` for production inference via Flask

### 5\. Deployment

* Built a **Flask web application** — users input network traffic features and receive instant attack classification
* Containerized with **Docker** for easy portability and deployment
* Originally deployed on Heroku (migrating to Render — see below)

## 💡 Key Learnings \& Future Improvements

**What worked well:**

* NSL-KDD is a cleaner version of the original KDD'99 dataset — eliminates duplicate records that caused overfitting in older research
* Two-problem framing (binary + multi-class) provides flexibility for different deployment scenarios
* pandas-profiling for automated EDA saved significant exploration time

**Future enhancements:**

* \[ ] Upgrade to **deep learning** — LSTM or CNN to capture sequential network packet patterns
* \[ ] Add **real-time packet capture** using Scapy or PyShark for live traffic analysis
* \[ ] Build an **alert dashboard** with Streamlit showing live attack rate charts
* \[ ] Test on newer datasets: **CICIDS2017** or **UNSW-NB15** for modern attack types
* \[ ] Add **SHAP values** to explain why a specific connection was flagged as an attack
* \[ ] Implement **MLflow** for experiment tracking across model versions
* \[ ] Explore **federated learning** for privacy-preserving NIDS across distributed networks

## 🔒 Cybersecurity Context

This project addresses two fundamentally different detection paradigms:

**Misuse-based Detection** (Signature-based): Matches known attack patterns — favoured in commercial products for high accuracy and predictability.

**Anomaly-based Detection** (this project's approach): Uses ML to learn "normal" behaviour and flag deviations — more powerful as it can detect **novel, previously unseen attacks** that signature-based systems miss entirely.
